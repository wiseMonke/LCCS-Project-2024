        <h2><u>Primary Research I conducted</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I created a survey on Microsoft Forms to gather data on potential end users for my product.</li>
            <li>I sent every 6th year in my school the survey and collected the response on excel and sorted them out into different sheets. I also graphed the data, using the graph function on excel as this allows me to read the data more easily and interpret it quicker.</li>
            <li>A problem I faced was that, not everyone responded to my survey, I only got 30 students out of my whole year (110 students) answering my survey in the whole week.</li>
            <li>I also was aware of the fact, that my data and demographic interest is heavily skewed and biassed and not representative of the whole population. This is because I only asked 17-18 year old, male teenagers, who are in school (and only 25% of those answered). (If I had more time and more resources, I would have picked a better sample population, consisting of people from every demographic to get the most accurate demographic data about the population)</li>
            <li>My main goals from doing the forms, was to figure out the INTEREST, DEMAND, USEFULNESS, DEMOGRAPHICS, USER-NEEDS and FEATURES</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><u>User Needs</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users want a highly customizable product, which they can make their own and add their own vibe.</li>
            <li>Users want a highly portable product, which can run everywhere and must have a good battery life, as they hate having to charge it regularly</li>
            <li>Users ideally are looking for a cheaper alternative to current fitness trackers on the market.</li>
            <li>Users also are very concerned about their privacy and biometric data.This means, we needs to store data safely.</li>
            <li>The Users also wanted the product to be accurate. They saw no reason to switch from industry leaders, unless my product was more accurate.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><u>Existing Products and Solutions</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently, there are a couple of products that partially fulfil the features of my product.
                Examples are (Apple Watch, Samsung Watch, FitBit & Garmin trackers). These are the industry standard and leaders in this market.
                </li>
            <li>There are many fitness trackers that accurately track sleep and stress. These trackers use external sensors to do so.</li>
            <li>There currently are no commercial products, that combine all three factors (sleep, stress & light levels) and determine your happiness level via a video.</li>
            <li>My product has a downside as it does not measure/track the above factors but instead relies on User Input about their satisfaction of the three factors (sleep, stress & light levels) to bias the ML algorithm to show the (%) happiness (maybe less accurate).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><u>Features of my product and its USP (Unique Selling Point)</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is highly customisable and you can always add more sensors and trackers to the Raspberry Pi in the future.</li>
            <li>It is open-source as all the code is available to read and you can customise it to your wish.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than the other solutions in the market ($40, $30 for Rpi & $10 for camera module).</li>
            <li>Offers data security as the data is stored locally.</li>
        </ul>
